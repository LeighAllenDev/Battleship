# BattleShips
## Code Institute Learner Project 03

## Site Overview
This project allows the player to play the classic game of Battleship against the Computer.

The computer generates 4 ships and the player has 50 shots to try to sink all of the battleships. If they hit them all they win the game, if the user runs out of bullets they loose the game.

Legend:
1. "." Empty space or water
2. "#" Water thats been hit, a miss as the space isn't part of a ship
3. "X" Part of a ship has been hit
4. "0" Part of a ship, this isn't seen by the player
