# BattleShips
## Code Institute Learner Project 03

## Intro
This project allows the player to play the classic game of Battleship against the Computer in a termimal game using Python3.

The player chooses the board size, then chooses how many ships they have to find. The computer then calculates and places the ships on the board and provides the user with a calculated amount of shots to make the game fair yet balanced. 

Legend:
1. "." Empty space or water
2. "#" Water thats been hit, a miss as the space isn't part of a ship
3. "X" Part of a ship has been hit
4. "0" Part of a ship, this isn't seen by the player. However, it can be accessed in debug mode and it will locate all the ships on the board.
